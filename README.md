# atmTurbulence_ENERGI322

## Summary
Excercise and set of python functions for the course on random processes and atmospheric turbulence [ENERGI210](https://www.uib.no/en/course/ENERGI322) at the University of Bergen (UiB). These functions and excercise are inspired by some of the earlier work in e.g. [1-4].

## Content

The repository contains:
- **Ex1.pdf** which is the assignment.
- **functions.py** which is the set of functions to be used in the main script.
- **script_to_be_completed.py** which is the script used to complete the assignment.
